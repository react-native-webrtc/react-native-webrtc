## iOS Installation

Starting with React Native 0.60 auto-linking works out of the box, so there are no extra steps.

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure you are using CocoaPods 1.10 or higher.

See a sample app in the `examples/GumTestApp` directory.

### Manual linking (using CocoaPods)

This is not needed with React Native >= 0.60.

You can use the included podspec in your Podfile to take care of all dependencies.

Include in the Podfile in your react-native ios directory:

```
pod 'react-native-webrtc', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-webrtc'
```

</details>

### Adjusting the supported platform version

You may have to change the `platform` field in your Podfile, as `react-native-webrtc` doesn't support iOS < 11 - set it to '11.0' or above (otherwise you get an error when doing `pod install`):

```
platform :ios, '11.0'
```

### Declare permissions in Info.plist

Navigate to `<ProjectFolder>/ios/<ProjectName>/` and edit `Info.plist` adding the following lines:

```
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Camera permission description</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Microphone permission description</string>
```

## FAQ

### Library not loaded/Code signature invalid

This is an issue with iOS 13.3.1. All dynamic frameworks being compiled to the newest release of iOS 13.3.1 are experiencing this issue when run on a personal provisioning profile/developer account. Use a non-Personal Team provisioning profile (paid developer account).
