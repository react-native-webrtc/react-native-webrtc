/**
 * Similarly to the CSS property z-index, specifies the z-order of this
 * RTCView in the stacking space of all RTCViews. When RTCViews overlap,
 * zOrder determines which one covers the other. An RTCView with a larger
 * zOrder generally covers an RTCView with a lower one.
 *
 * Non-overlapping RTCViews may safely share a z-order (because one does not
 * have to cover the other).
 *
 * The support for zOrder is platform-dependent and/or
 * implementation-specific. Thus, specifying a value for zOrder is to be
 * thought of as giving a hint rather than as imposing a requirement. For
 * example, video renderers such as RTCView are commonly implemented using
 * OpenGL and OpenGL views may have different numbers of layers in their
 * stacking space. Android has three: a layer bellow the window (aka
 * default), a layer bellow the window again but above the previous layer
 * (aka media overlay), and above the window. Consequently, it is advisable
 * to limit the number of utilized layers in the stacking space to the
 * minimum sufficient for the desired display. For example, a video call
 * application usually needs a maximum of two zOrder values: 0 for the
 * remote video(s) which appear in the background, and 1 for the local
 * video(s) which appear above the remote video(s).
 *
 * zOrder: number
