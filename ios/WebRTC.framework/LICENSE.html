ACE(TM), TAO(TM), CIAO(TM), DAnCE&gt;(TM), and CoSMIC(TM) (henceforth referred to
as &quot;DOC software&quot;) are copyrighted by Douglas C. Schmidt and his research
group at Washington University, University of California, Irvine, and
Vanderbilt University, Copyright (c) 1993-2009, all rights reserved. Since DOC
software is open-source, freely available software, you are free to use,
modify, copy, and distribute--perpetually and irrevocably--the DOC software
source code and object code produced from the source, as well as copy and
distribute modified versions of this software. You must, however, include this
copyright statement along with any code built using DOC software that you
release. No copyright statement needs to be provided if you just ship binary
executables of your software products.
You can use DOC software in commercial and/or binary software releases and are
under no obligation to redistribute any of your source code that is built
using DOC software. Note, however, that you may not misappropriate the DOC
software code, such as copyrighting it yourself or claiming authorship of the
DOC software code, in a way that will prevent DOC software from being
distributed freely using an open-source development model. You needn't inform
anyone that you're using DOC software in your software, though we encourage
you to let us know so we can promote your project in the DOC software success
stories.

The ACE, TAO, CIAO, DAnCE, and CoSMIC web sites are maintained by the DOC
Group at the Institute for Software Integrated Systems (ISIS) and the Center
for Distributed Object Computing of Washington University, St. Louis for the
development of open-source software as part of the open-source software
community. Submissions are provided by the submitter ``as is'' with no
warranties whatsoever, including any warranty of merchantability,
noninfringement of third party intellectual property, or fitness for any
particular purpose. In no event shall the submitter be liable for any direct,
indirect, special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages, including
without limitation, lost profits, even if advised of the possibility of such
damages. Likewise, DOC software is provided as is with no warranties of any
kind, including the warranties of design, merchantability, and fitness for a
particular purpose, noninfringement, or arising from a course of dealing,
usage or trade practice. Washington University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt
University, their employees, and students shall have no liability with respect
to the infringement of copyrights, trade secrets or any patents by DOC
software or any part thereof. Moreover, in no event will Washington
University, UC Irvine, or Vanderbilt University, their employees, or students
be liable for any lost revenue or profits or other special, indirect and
consequential damages.

DOC software is provided with no support and without any obligation on the
part of Washington University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University, their
employees, or students to assist in its use, correction, modification, or
enhancement. A number of companies around the world provide commercial support
for DOC software, however. DOC software is Y2K-compliant, as long as the
underlying OS platform is Y2K-compliant. Likewise, DOC software is compliant
with the new US daylight savings rule passed by Congress as &quot;The Energy Policy
Act of 2005,&quot; which established new daylight savings times (DST) rules for the
United States that expand DST as of March 2007. Since DOC software obtains
time/date and calendaring information from operating systems users will not be
affected by the new DST rules as long as they upgrade their operating systems
accordingly.

A “contributor” is any person that distributes its contribution under this
license.

“Licensed patents” are a contributor’s patent claims that read directly on its
contribution.

2. Grant of Rights

(A) Copyright Grant - Subject to the terms of this license, including the
license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce its
contribution, prepare derivative works of its contribution, and distribute its
contribution or any derivative works that you create.

(B) Patent Grant - Subject to the terms of this license, including the license
conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a

the software.

3. Conditions and Limitations

(A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use any
contributors’ name, logo, or trademarks.

(B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you
claim are infringed by the software, your patent license from such contributor
to the software ends automatically.

(C) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain all
copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the
software.

(D) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you may
do so only under this license by including a complete copy of this license
with your distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software in
compiled or object code form, you may only do so under a license that complies
with this license.

(E) The software is licensed “as-is.” You bear the risk of using it. The
contributors give no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may

exclude the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose and non-infringement.

(F) Platform Limitation - The licenses granted in sections 2(A) and 2(B)
extend only to the software or derivative works that you create that run on a
Microsoft Windows operating system product.

BoringSSL is a fork of OpenSSL. As such, large parts of it fall under OpenSSL
licensing. Files that are completely new have a Google copyright and an ISC
license. This license is reproduced at the bottom of this file.

Contributors to BoringSSL are required to follow the CLA rules for Chromium:
https://cla.developers.google.com/clas

Some files from Intel are under yet another license, which is also included
underneath.

The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of the
OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit. See below
for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style Open Source
licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL please contact
openssl-core@openssl.org.

The following are Google-internal bug numbers where explicit permission from
some authors is recorded for use of their work. (This is purely for our own
record keeping.)
